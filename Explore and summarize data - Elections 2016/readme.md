<img src="2016 elections finance1.jpg" />

<br>The full analysis of this project (All.html) can be read as on my <a href ="https://u4see.org/data/2016-elections/all.html">website</a>, or downloaded from here. Github won't let you open the file here due to its large size.<br>

The main dataset used in this project was downloaded from the <a href ="https://classic.fec.gov/disclosurep/PDownload.do">EFC website</a> and is called '2016 Presidential Campaign Finance' (ALL.zip).<br>

Other datasets that I used in the course of this project were:
<a href ="https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-national-total.html">cencus.gov</a> for US population and states information, like zipcodes, longitude and latitude.<br>
<a href ="https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities">simplemaps.com</a> for data about the US cities.<br>

This project is comprised of the following main files:<br>
all-munge.R - where most of the data wrangling is done.<br>
all.RMD - where the actual analysis process is done.<br>
all.HTML - The file that outputs an HTML version of the all.RMD<br>
contrib_map_cities.html - an interactive map of the US cities and their financial statistics.<br>
contrib_map_states_cities.html - an interactive map with the states and the cities statistics.<br>
finance_date_cand.html - an interactive plot with the aggregated sum of contributions candidates received on a time scale.<br>
readme.MD - this file<br>
