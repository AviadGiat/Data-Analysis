I also added completing data from other sources to acheive better and more accurate analysis. More information about them in the Exploration 1 file.

## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration of the data I found the followings:
Guns Sense was the pac that endorsed the highest numbre of candidates (193). On the same time I found that Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden had 10 or less endorsements, which seemd odd to me. After adding their missing data Bernie came up with 26 endorsements and Biden too the seond place from Our Revolution with 98 endorsements. From politicians who endorsed candidates publically, Biden came out the first.
Interesting to learn from the data exploration that the DCCC (Democratic Party endorsements) endorsed only 22 candidates. Nevertheless, when examining this pac's success rate, they had the best one from all pacs with 91%. Here I also found that there is no correlation between how well a pac did, as percent of success from their own pool of candidates running, and the number of endorsements they had. On the other hand, as pacs had more endorsements, they had more winnings, with a very strong correlation.
Progressive candidates comprised 12.5% of the total candidates population (105 out of 839).
Progressives won in 46 different primaries from 264 combats that ended with winnings, which is 5.5% success rate.
From the Progressives population of 105, 44% succeeded with their primaries. One Progessive received 7 endorsements, 3 had 6 endorsements and 13 others had 5 endorsements. Only 3 other candidates were at the top 26 most endorsed candidates in those primaries.
Percentage of support for winning candidates was very much spread out, starting with 18% and ending in 91% of the votes. The average votes a winner received was 54%. As far as Progressives, they did not have overall a better voting rate in those primaries.
Texas and California had the highest number of candidates competing and also the states with the highest number of Progressive candidates. Progressives won in 17 states, with the highest numbers were Texas with 11 winnings, California with 4 and New York with 4 as well.
The Democratic party's candidates in those elections were mostly white, more than 2 times the amount of non-white candidates (449, compare to 200). All pacs supported substantially more white candidates than non-white, where the only pac to endorse more non-white candidates was the PCCC (Progressive Change Campaign Committee). When comparing the percent of votes of the Party Support and the 3 Progressive pacs together, I found that the Party performed better than the Progressive pacs. The average for the party, with 68%, was twice as high as the Progressive one, with 35% average of the votes. The Party Support pac not only had more white candidates, but also had a much higher average and performnce in general than non-Whites in the party. Whites also lead the vote percent in the Progressive pacs.


Summarize all of your findings from your exploration here, whether you plan on bringing them into your explanatory presentation or not.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> In the Presentation I focused more on the Progressive candidates and pacs, yet, incorporated general information about th erest of the candidates and pacs that completed the picture for the Progressives and seemed to me interesting for common knowledge.
I built the presentation both wide and long. I made from each of the main variables and the supporting variables a slide, which then had sub-slides with bi and multi vaiant analysis. I also made sure that each of the main and supporting variables has a unique color to be able to follow the analysis easier of each one easier.
