# 2018 Elections - Progressive Victories in the Democratic party
## By Aviad Giat



## Investigation Overview
In this analysis, I will look into the 2018 Democratic primaries elections' statistics and find how the progressive movement's candidates did with winning (or losing) the combats. I will also try to find outstanding data about those elections and investigate them deeper if I find them interesting for the common knowledge. 



## Main Motivation
As an avid politics follower, I would like to learn interesting statistics about the 2018 Democratic Primaries and find outstanding data that can shed light on those elections. More specifically, inspect the Progressive movement's performances across different topics/variables, as individual candidates and as pacs (Political Action Committees).



## Dataset
I obtained the data used in this analysis from Five Thirty-Eight's <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/primary-candidates-2018">Github repository</a>.<br>
I also added completing data from other sources to achieve better and more accurate analysis.<br> More information about them in the Exploration 1 file.<br>

<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Endorsements_by_Bernie_Sanders">Bernie Sanders missing data (from ballotpedia.org)</a>

## Summary of Findings
In the exploration of the data I found the followings:
Guns Sense was the pac that endorsed the highest number of candidates, 193. Joe Biden took the second place and Our Revolution was the third with 98 endorsements. From politicians who endorsed candidates publicly, Biden came out the first.<br><br>

Interesting to learn from the data exploration that the DCCC (Democratic Party endorsements) endorsed only 22 candidates. Nevertheless, when examining this pac's success rate, they had the best one from all pacs with 91%. Here I also found that there is no correlation between how well a pac did, as a percent of success from their own pool of candidates, and the number of endorsements they had. On the other hand, as pacs had more or fewer endorsements, they had more or fewer winnings, with a very strong correlation.<br><br>

Progressive candidates comprised 12.5% of the total candidates' population (105 out of 839) and won in 47 different primaries from 264 combats that ended with winnings, which is 5.5% success rate. From the Progressives population of 106, 44% succeeded with their primaries. One Progressive received 7 endorsements, 3 had 6 endorsements and 13 others had 5 endorsements. Only 3 other candidates were at the top 26 most endorsed candidates in those primaries.<br><br>

Percentage of support for winning candidates was very much spread out, starting with 18% and ending in 91% of the votes. The average votes a winner received was 54%. As far as Progressives, they did not have overall a better voting rate in those primaries.<br><br>

Texas and California had the highest number of candidates competing and also the states with the highest number of Progressive candidates. Progressives won in 17 states, with the highest numbers were Texas with 11 winnings, California with 4 and New York with 4 as well.<br><br>

The Democratic party's candidates in those elections were mostly white, more than 2 times the amount of non-white candidates (449, compared to 200). All pacs supported substantially more white candidates than non-white, where the only pac to endorse more non-white candidates was the PCCC (Progressive Change Campaign Committee). <br><br>

When comparing the Percent of Votes of the Party Support and the 3 Progressive pacs together, I found that the Party performed better than the Progressive pacs. The average for the party, with 68%, was twice as high as the Progressive one, with 35% average of the votes. The Party Support pac not only had more white candidates but also had a much higher average and performance in general than non-Whites in the party. Whites also lead the vote percentage in the Progressive pacs.


## Key Insights for Presentation
In the Presentation I focused more on the Progressive candidates and pacs, yet, incorporated general information about the rest of the candidates and pacs that completed the picture for the Progressives and seemed, to me, interesting for common knowledge.<br>
I built the presentation both wide and long. I made from each of the main variables and the supporting variables a slide, which then had sub-slides with bi and Multi-vaiant analysis. I also made sure that each of the main and supporting variables has a unique color to be able to follow the analysis easier.
